1. The majority of the pink area (close area) is centered at the sticky note on the window with some pink pixels random appear on the image, especially the on the area around the note and right above the sticky note to the right. The reason that the pink pixels’ scattering around might result from the different displacement of sticky note relative to the background from real1-left and real1-right. In the image real1-right, the sticky note shifts almost half of its width to the left compared to the note in the real1-left. This adds to the difficulties of find the precise corresponding feature in the right image and resulting the longer normalized distance. Moreover, another reason of mismatching might the similar color tone of the sticky note and that of the surrounding, for example, the sky.

2. The algorithm works better on the these images. The reason might due to the fact that sticky note shifts less in the real2-right compared to in the real2-left. By making the white spot on the left of sticky note as the reference point, the displacement or shifting of the note is relative smaller in contrast to the large shifting in real1 images. Moreover, the is a more obvious color contrast of the sticky note and its surrounding from the original images, which could help the function to match the pixel on the two images.

3. The the size of the features become bigger and bigger the output images become more blur, that is, the word “Cal” become harder to identify. The reason might be that when feature_width = feature_height = 0, the function is searching in the right image pixel by pixel. However, as the feature_width and feature_height become bigger, the problem of Squared Euclidean Distance start to influence the outcome of output images. With the increasing of feature size, the matching accuracy decreases.
